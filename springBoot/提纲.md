##### Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition



NAS

 Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework [71] uses a reinforcement learning search method to optimize architecture configurations. Applying NAS, or any other search methods, directly to a large dataset, such as the ImageNet dataset, is however computationally expensive. They therefore propose to search for a good architecture on a proxy dataset, for example the smaller CIFAR-10 dataset, and then transfer the learned architecture to ImageNet. We achieve this transferrability by designing a search space (which we call “the NASNet search space”) so that the complexity of the architecture is independent of the depth of the network and the size of input images. More concretely, all convolutional networks in our search space are composed of convolutional layers (or “cells”) with identical structure but different weights. Searching for the best convolutional architectures is therefore reduced to searching for the best cell structure. Searching for the best cell structure has two main benefits: it is much faster than searching for an entire network architecture and the cell itself is more likely to generalize to other problems. I
